# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots - Final Capstone Project - Summer Analytics

This project on Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots was completed as part of the Summer Analytics course conducted by [CAIITG](https://www.caciitg.com/). The goal was to model dynamic price adjustments for urban parking spots based on features like occupancy, capacity, queue length, traffic conditions, and special days. Along with basic data exploration and visualization, two pricing models were developed:

1. **Simple Linear Model** - Price depends linearly on the occupancy level of the parking lot.
2. **Demand-Based Pricing Function** - A non-linear function designed to capture more complex patterns in demand over time.
